I will introduce you to a number of resources that I have been relying on.</p><p>I aim to be able to tell something about plants I see around me most frequently. I also want to build up my ability to recognise plants that are edible, medicinal, or otherwise useful. Right now I am far behind an average member of forager or early agrarian societies that would have lived in our area in the past, but I hope to eventually catch up!</p><h2 id="visual-recognision" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#visual-recognision" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Visual recognision</h2><p>Knowledge of the natural world used to be passed orally. A member of your community would point to a plant and tell you its name, and you could learn what it was for by observing others and listening to stories.</p><p>It can be difficult to obtain knowledge in this way now, because when you don't know what a particular plant is, you might not be able to immediately ask someone.</p><p>Modern technology provides an equivalent: you can take a picture and ask your phone. I use a free open source app, <a href="https://plantnet.org/en/">PlantNet</a>, which has a large user community, and has been developed by a collaboration of French universities since 2009. It might be the best one out there - I've seen people use commercial apps for this, and their results didn't seem as good.</p><p>PlantNet is endlessly patient with me, and provides me with photos submitted by others which I can then compare to the specimen I am identifying. Taking a good picture is key to getting good results: it should show leaf arrangement and shape. However, a PlantNet guess should not be your only basis for identifying a plant you don't know, particularly if it's something you are considering eating.</p><h2 id="plant-systematics" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#plant-systematics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Plant systematics</h2><p>Many plant characteristics that we find easiest to observe are not a reliable basis for identification. For example, habit (whether something is a tree or a shrub) or leaf shape can vary between cultivars of the same species, and leaf size and color can change within the same plant in response to growing conditions.</p><p>Fortunately, scientists are able to determine how plants are related to each other using a number of techniques. They maintain a taxonomy - a multi-level classification describing how plants related to each other based on their ancestry - and identify so-called synapomorphies ( i.e. common characteristics ) for groupings. Recognising the shared characteristics can help you identify a plant down to a genus or family, and tell you a lot about a specimen, even if you don't know the species. For example, plants in the mint family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamiaceae"><em>Lamiaceae</em></a> usually have aromatic leaves which taste good in tea, and the common identifying characteristics - square stems and opposite leaves - can be easily identified. You can learn an overview of eight common families from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1DePlU15z4">this video</a> by Thomas Elpel, the author of the book Botany In A Day.</p><h2 id="self-studying-botany" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#self-studying-botany" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Self-studying botany</h2><p>Contemporary knowledge about plants spans across hundreds of thousands of species, and it is vastly greater than what anyone might have known in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of it is communicated through specialised language and concepts, and it is difficult to access without some background in botany.</p><p>It is definitely possible for you to learn botany through self-study. One person who learned botany in this way is the author of a popular YouTube channel Crime Pays But Botany Doesn't, and now makes a living from making videos about plants, which are very informative as well as amusing, although not for everyone's sense of humour. If you want to see his recommendations, see <a href="https://www.crimepaysbutbotanydoesnt.com/reading-list">his reading list</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z314Njbw5k0">his introductory video on YouTube</a> - this includes Botany In A Day mentioned above.</p><p>I have gotten a lot of benefit from Alexey Shipunov's <a href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Botany/Introduction_to_Botany_(Shipunov)">Introduction To Botany</a>, which the author kindly made freely available. It is a university level textbook, and I needed to read it more than once even though I wasn't new to biology or plants, but I appreciated its focus on high-level concepts.</p><h2 id="reference-books" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#reference-books" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reference books</h2><p>If you are comfortable with the language of botany and are able to describe characteristics like shape of leaves in a specimen, you can consult a reference book. <em>New flora of the British Isles</em> is a standard comprehensive text in Britain and covers over 4800 plants, though mostly without illustration. You can see which libraries have it available <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/new-flora-of-the-british-isles/oclc/1089411862">here through WorldCat</a>.</p></article><div class="lg:text-lg py-8"><hr><ul><li>Next: <a class="link" href="/articles/using-medicinal-plants/">Responsibly using medicinal plants</a></li><li><a href="/articles" class="link">See all articles</a></li></ul></div></section></div></body></html>
