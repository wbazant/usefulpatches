Unfortunately, this demand is frequently exploited by providers of miracle cures, which we need to avoid if we want to get good results and stay away from disastrous outcomes.</p><p>This is a short text about avoiding harm when using plants for medicinal use. Since I am not a medical professional, I couldn't prescribe you treatments, herbal or otherwise. Instead, I will focus on what standards of evidence seem adequate to me and what I consider responsible when it comes to herbalism, and discuss my own approach.</p><h3 id="medicine-is-the-study-and-practice-of-healing" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#medicine-is-the-study-and-practice-of-healing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Medicine is the study and practice of healing</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease">Disease</a> is an unhealthy state where something bad happens to the body or mind. Descriptions of diseases typically include their causes, which are meant to be understandable and based in observations of many people.</p><p>If someone feels unwell and they want to know why, they may for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis">diagnosis</a>. Getting advice from someone experienced is a good way of getting a useful diagnosis - it takes a lot of time to learn about many different diseases that people can have. Self-diagnosis can be unreliable because it is hard to be objective when it comes to our own bodies. For this reason, medical professionals don't diagnose themselves: they ask a colleague instead.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy">Treatment</a> is what people do to try to solve or care for a health problem. Someone with experience in treating a particular disease is more likely to choose a wise course of treatment. Additionally, treatments that are known to have worked for similar cases in the past are more likely to get good results than treatments that are untested, untestable or proven ineffective.</p><p>My approach to medicinal plants is rooted quite firmly in a modern approach to those three concepts: diseases can be understood, giving a diagnosis may be tricky, standard treatments are most reliable. This helps me make sure I am not blindly chasing solutions, and when I do undergo treatment, I am more likely to get good outcomes. When I hear a health-related claim that contradicts my basic understanding of medicine, I respect it, but I don't reach for the wallet.</p><h3 id="medications-should-be-effective-and-safe" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#medications-should-be-effective-and-safe" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Medications should be effective and safe</h3><p>In the most narrow understanding of medicine, only chemical compounds are used for healing. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal_medicine">herbalism</a> is practiced as a drop-in replacement for pharmaceutical drugs, it is based on compounds found inside plants - which they produce for they own purposes, for example, not being eaten by slugs.</p><p>Using plants in this way can be very practical, but only if they work and if they don't harm us. Before a pharmaceutical company is allowed to sell a drug, it needs to show a lot of evidence about its suitability as a treatment. The system we have for this is not perfect - actually, it's fairly broken, it blocks access to some substances that are clearly beneficial, and it doesn't stop inscrupulous practicies of some companies - but I think the basic approach is sound enough. We don't have to 'believe in big pharma' to apply the same evidence-based framework: does the plant actually do something, and is it likely to harm me if I take it?</p><h2 id="how-to-'do-your-own-research'" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#how-to-'do-your-own-research'" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How to 'do your own research'</h2><p>To find what scientists discovered about a plant, I can search <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">PubMed</a>, which is a listing of peer-reviewed studies from scientific journals. This is essentially the forefront of knowledge - things appear there soon after they get discovered and verified. In general, we can trust published and peer-reviewed studies, although some journals are not credible and sometimes scientists make mistakes. Synthesising studies into an overall picture of what is known to be true is not easy, but it's the best an individual can do when 'doing their own research'.</p><p>An alternative to reading primary sources is to use someone's summary of the available knowledge. Credibility of the sources is an issue to look out for, but we can use common sense. We should also be able to tell when we're out of our depth - something I remember from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is everyone becoming an armchair epidemiologist, and quite a few of my friends became armchair virologists as well.</p><h3 id="example" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#example" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Example</h3><p>Red clover (<em>Trifolium pratense</em>) is a very useful plant with edible flowers. It grows commonly in Scottish lowlands, doing very well on ungrazed meadows, and I think it's worth encouraging in gardens because it's pretty, valuable as food, looks after itself, feeds pollinators, fixes nitrogen, and provides ground cover. Let's try to find out whether it also has something to offer as a medicinal plant.</p><h4 id="using-pubmed" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#using-pubmed" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Using PubMed</h4><p>I typed the Latin name of the plant into PubMed, skipped the ecological and agrotechnical research, and picked two studies that are interesting to compare. They are both recent ( published in 2021 ) and are both metaanalyses (studies based on other studies).</p><ol><li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34392659/">Pharmacological and therapeutic properties of the Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.): an overview of the new finding</a> in a Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine</li><li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33920485/">Evaluation of Clinical Meaningfulness of Red clover ( Trifolium pratense L.) Extract to Relieve Hot Flushes and Menopausal Symptoms in Peri- and Post-Menopausal Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials </a>in Nutrients</li></ol><p>I trust 2. more than 1. In 1. the authors' methodology is to search for articles and find everything Red clover seems to be good for, and their results seem to be list of everything they find, and it's vague: stuff like &quot;anti-cancer effects&quot;. 2. is much better from the start, because the authors start out with a specific task - to conclude whether Red clover relieves menopausal hot flushes. They give a precise answer about what they found (1.79 fewer hot flushes per day) and are clear about their evidence ( a review of eight trials ). Still, when I open and read 2., I find that it's still not a very conclusive study: the eight trials only investigate 379 patients in total. In their conclusion, the authors express caution, and say more studies are needed to settle the issue.</p><h4 id="comparing-to-what's-on-health-websites" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#comparing-to-what's-on-health-websites" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comparing to what's on health websites</h4><p>If you search for &quot;Red clover benefits&quot; you will see a repeated mention of hot flushes. People who make these sites want you to stay and click around so that they can show you ads, so they have incentives to simplify things and tell you what you might want to hear. Because of this, it's quite easy to be mislaid into thinking that the evidence for its therapeutic potential, or the benefit from taking it, is much stronger than what has actually been discovered. The next stop from there is false hope. People might go to a shopping website like Amazon, where everything is again designed to be very persuasive - green bottles with beautiful <em>Trifolium pratense</em> specimens at the front, descriptions containing words like &quot;potent&quot; or mentioning of menopause, and the products are not even that expensive. Of course, neither the &quot;alternative medicine knowledge base&quot; sites or herbal supplement shop sites explicitly promise any benefit, because they would get sued for medical fraud.</p><p>&quot;Hot flushes NHS&quot; is a better search. It does list red clover among a few other plants where small studies indicate a potential therapeautic effect while cautioning you that the research on it is patchy. It also includes a useful mention of side effects (women taking anticoagulants shouldn't take red clover) that a &quot;Red clover benefits&quot; search might miss.</p><h4 id="my-verdict" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#my-verdict" aria-hidden="true">#</a> My verdict</h4><p>Personally, I am convinced enough that red clover may be of therapeutic help in some circumstances, to treat it as an additional reason for encouraging its patches in gardens. I wouldn't tell anyone to buy it as a supplement - actually, I actively ask people to not give their money to companies that sell such things, as they do not do it with people's health in mind. If you think it might help you one day and you don't have it around, I recommend you sow it in your garden: it's a great plant for many other reasons and due to red clover being used as ground cover on agricultural scale, the seed is incredibly cheap. You can also forage for it - it's abundant in meadows, and I saw it grown in strips on Malls Mire.</p><h2 id="good-sources-of-knowledge" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#good-sources-of-knowledge" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Good sources of knowledge</h2><h3 id="identifying-medicinal-plants-that-are-useful-to-you" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#identifying-medicinal-plants-that-are-useful-to-you" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Identifying medicinal plants that are useful to you</h3><p>If you're planning to practice medicine on yourself, probably the most responsible way to do it is to do what practicioners of medicine typically do. That means you would start with a therapeutic need you have identified, and see if there are any plants that will help you address it. For this, you can search <a href="https://pfaf.org">Plants For A Future</a>, which is a publicly available resource of useful plants. They list reports of plants being used medicinally, for example in folk stories or by Indigenous societies, and then they apply their judgement to provide an overall rating. If something's 3/5, 4/5 or 5/5 for medicinal use it might be worth looking into.</p><p>I don't typically go to a pharmacy and buy random chemicals to pop down, but I am quite happy to explore physiological effects that plants have on me, once I check they're not toxic. It's usually when I find something that's abundant in my immediate environment - for example, young blackberry leaves in my tenement garden in springtime - and want to learn about its use. THe th</p><p>The third way to do this is to read about plants on the Internet, and who of us doesn't! :). There's an excellent foraging resource about plants in our local area, <a href="https://gallowaywildfoods.com">Galloway Wild Foods</a> by Mark Williams.</p><h3 id="being-able-to-tell-what-a-plant-does" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#being-able-to-tell-what-a-plant-does" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Being able to tell what a plant does</h3><p>Inclusive resources like the PFAF website typically describe many effects each plant may have. I don't understand many of them. If a plant was not shown to have a therapeutic effect in clinical trials, I can't think of it as medicinal, unless I stick to effects where I can reasonably tell if a plant has done something for me.</p><p>For example, when I read about goji berries containing antioxidants and thus being &quot;good for me&quot;, it's not followed by therapeutic evidence, but an explanation of what an antioxidant is and what it does in the body, which I don't understand and it actually makes me feel intimidated and a bit stupid, because it's formulated in the language of organic chemistry and it's full of concepts I am not familiar with.</p><p>On the other hand, I'm comfortable with using a plant that is meant to temporarily reduce fatigue. An example everyone knows is coffee, the <em>Coffea arabica</em> bean extract. People can make informed decisions about its use: it has a temporary benefit which is very useful when you need to stay awake for something, taking too much or taking it too late messes with your sleep, and so on.</p><h2 id="my-experience" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#my-experience" aria-hidden="true">#</a> My experience</h2><p>Sometimes I have problems falling asleep, and one of the ways in which I've been trying to heal from this is through herbal teas. I choose ones that I can source and that I find enjoyable - rosebay willowherb (<em>Chamaenerion angustifolium</em>) and linden (<em>Tilia</em> genus) are both excellent - rather than ones which are confirmed to have strong physiological effects: I grow valerian (<em>Valeriana officinalis</em>) for the sake of having access to a sedative, but it wouldn't be responsible for me to habitually start using something like that.</p><p>I've not measured if the teas help me with sleep, but they seem to be doing so, and I feel positive about their role in my life. It might not be due to compounds in the teas making it to my bloodstream and interacting with receptors in the brain - which is how valerian is known to work, for instance - and I don't really have to know why they help. Maybe it's the intention with which I drink them, the experience of holding a warm cup, or the acts of harvesting, storing, and preparing the tea.</p><p>When I harvest rosebay willowherb leaves, process them through fermentation, and finally take out the leaves in the evening to make that tea that will help me with sleep, I am not giving myself a medical treatment. I'm assuming it has a physiological effect on me, but it doesn't actually matter: what I'm really engaging in is a ritual. A clear sign of this is that I don't actually try to depend on any compounds in the tea, I just made sure there are no reliable toxicity reports about it. Additionally, I engage in the process as a whole - it probably wouldn't work as well if someone gave me the leaves, because they wouldn't come with memories of me collecting the plants, or the smell of fermenting leaves filling up the house. The first few times I tried rosebay willowherb I was really curious about what it will do for me, and it was thus more of a recreational use, but it's a rather mild high.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="direct-link" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Conclusion</h2><p>Going to a NHS doctor is the only disease treatment I can responsibly recommend. Please stay away from commercial herbalism: websites with ads on them, herbal product companies, and herbalists who are '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine">alternative medicine</a>' practicioners. They impose economic harm on people as a direct consequence of their business models, in addition to other forms of harm - for example, interfering with effective treatment, creating false hope, and they can even be giving people preparations that are actually harmful.</p><p>Practicing medicine on yourself using grown or foraged plants is an intrinsically unsafe activity, but it does not neccessarily have the harms of commercial herbalism. I think you can be okay if you understand what medicine is about, know how to get reliable information, and understand a thing or two about plants as well as human bodies - but it is crucial that you fully realise what you're doing, so that you can tell when you're out of your league.</p><p>On the other hand, it can be great to have medicinal plants that address a few of your frequent needs. When the need is minor, the inferior pharmaceutical value of a medicinal plant as compared to a drug with known composition and dosage doesn't really matter, and it is balanced out by its recreational, educational, and ritual values. You can have fun experimenting with what they do for you, learn about their biology and chemistry, and engage in a traditional way of processing the plant. And of course, if it all kicks off and we can no longer rely on pharmacies and doctors, the plants in your backyard will come in handy!</p></article><div class="lg:text-lg py-8"><hr><ul><li>Previous: <a class="link" href="/articles/how-to-identify-plants/">Learning to identify plants</a></li><li><a href="/articles" class="link">See all articles</a></li></ul></div></section></div></body></html>
