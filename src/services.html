  <h3> Service: Consultation</h3>
  <p> This is our most basic service: a member of our team arrives in your space, and helps you with anything you want. This can range from hands-on work teaching you a particular technique, a practical chat about a topic like composting, looking around and giving you any design ideas or pointers that are available to us on the spot, or a mini-lecture, although we try not to lecture!
  </p>
  <p>
  All of our <a href="/our-team">team members</a> are trained permaculture designers - our minimum requirement to join is completion of the half-yearly PDC with the Permaculture Association, or equivalent. You can also expect good working knowledge of topics like soil science, integrated pest management, botany, and urban horticulture. We are also all familiar with the native plants of our biome, and cultivated plants that are likely to do well.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is probably the most suitable service for you if you already have plans in space for your garden, there is something you would like to spend time on learning, or if you want specific advice. Our consultation costs £35 for an hour, or £60 if you need a longer two-hourly one.
  </p>
  <h3> Service: Design</h3>
  <p> We offer landscape design services based on principles of integrated design. We split them into two site appointments: the first meeting is a design brief where we agree on a scope and goals, followed by an in-depth client interview. Ideally we would like to talk to everyone who will be using the space, or at least get an idea of their needs and interests.
  </p>
  <p>
  We will try to then see what we can offer given your needs, available resources, and interests. To get a feel for the kinds of design elements this is likely to involve, have a look at our <a href="/examples"> Examples page </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you like, you can get the same kinds of results you would get from any other landscaping company, although we are yet to meet someone whose needs are best met by a monoculture lawn that is mown twice a month. We will not propose something that you are not able to implement or maintain without much external help.
  </p>
  <p>

Your patch can become useful and very elaborate: for example, we can help you establish a forest garden with seven layers of edible crops that make very efficient use of a small space. We can also aim for something very simple to establish and maintain, like a patch of mint that you only need to visit when you make yourself a cocktail!
  </p>
  <p>
  We do not sell plants, and so we have no incentive to lure you into exotic plantings or commit you to high implementation budgets. Our service includes information on sourcing the plants - you will be able to get them from mail-order nurseries, grow them from seed, or use material that can be bought at an ordinary grocery store. We also propagate a few useful plants like comfrey, which we give away for free.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our designs involve plans for implementation and maintenance that you can mostly do yourself, and without a large budget. They include advice on sourcing plants and contracting out specialised work.
  </p>
  <p>
  The cost of this service varies based on the scope of deliverables, but it should be about £100-200 for a 'patch' garden. We can agree on a price during the design brief phase, or you can email us ahead with the details and ask for a quote.
