## Visual recognision

Knowledge of the natural world used to be passed orally. A member of your community would point to a plant and tell you its name, and you could learn what it was for by observing others and listening to stories.

It can be difficult to obtain knowledge in this way now, because when you don't know what a particular plant is, you might not be able to immediately ask someone.

Modern technology provides an equivalent: you can take a picture and ask your phone. I use a free open source app, [PlantNet](https://plantnet.org/en/), which has a large user community, and has been developed by a collaboration of French universities since 2009. It might be the best one out there - I've seen people use commercial apps for this, and their results didn't seem as good.

PlantNet is endlessly patient with me, and provides me with photos submitted by others which I can then compare to the specimen I am identifying. Taking a good picture is key to getting good results: it should show leaf arrangement and shape. However, a PlantNet guess should not be your only basis for identifying a plant you don't know, particularly if it's something you are considering eating.

## Plant systematics

Many plant characteristics that we find easiest to observe are not a reliable basis for identification. For example, habit (whether something is a tree or a shrub) or leaf shape can vary between cultivars of the same species, and leaf size and color can change within the same plant in response to growing conditions.

Fortunately, scientists are able to determine how plants are related to each other using a number of techniques. They maintain a taxonomy - a multi-level classification describing how plants related to each other based on their ancestry - and identify so-called synapomorphies ( i.e. common characteristics ) for groupings. Recognising the shared characteristics can help you identify a plant down to a genus or family, and tell you a lot about a specimen, even if you don't know the species. For example, plants in the mint family [*Lamiaceae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamiaceae) usually have aromatic leaves which taste good in tea, and the common identifying characteristics - square stems and opposite leaves - can be easily identified. You can learn an overview of eight common families from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1DePlU15z4) by Thomas Elpel, the author of the book Botany In A Day.

## Self-studying botany

Contemporary knowledge about plants spans across hundreds of thousands of species, and it is vastly greater than what anyone might have known in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of it is communicated through specialised language and concepts, and it is difficult to access without some background in botany.

It is definitely possible for you to learn botany through self-study. One person who learned botany in this way is the author of a popular YouTube channel Crime Pays But Botany Doesn't, and now makes a living from making videos about plants, which are very informative as well as amusing, although not for everyone's sense of humour. If you want to see his recommendations, see [his reading list](https://www.crimepaysbutbotanydoesnt.com/reading-list) or [his introductory video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z314Njbw5k0) - this includes Botany In A Day mentioned above.

I have gotten a lot of benefit from Alexey Shipunov's [Introduction To Botany](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Botany/Introduction_to_Botany_(Shipunov)), which the author kindly made freely available. It is a university level textbook, and I needed to read it more than once even though I wasn't new to biology or plants, but I appreciated its focus on high-level concepts.


## Reference books

If you are comfortable with the language of botany and are able to describe characteristics like shape of leaves in a specimen, you can consult a reference book. *New flora of the British Isles* is a standard comprehensive text in Britain and covers over 4800 plants, though mostly without illustration. You can see which libraries have it available [https://www.worldcat.org/title/new-flora-of-the-british-isles/oclc/1089411862](here through WorldCat).
