Our most basic service is an hourly consultation for £30: we arrive at your space, tell you about anything you want to ask us, and give you all the design ideas and pointers we can come up with on the spot. The cost of our main design service varies with complexity, but it is typically in £100-200 for a suburban or tenement garden. We typically split it into two site appointments - at the first one, we conduct interviews and survey the space, and then we come back with our proposals. We also offer follow-up hourly visits, for £25.

We do not sell plants, and so we have no incentive to lure you into exotic plantings or commit you to high implementation budgets. Our service includes information on sourcing the plants - you will be able to get them from mail-order nurseries, grow them from seed, or use material that can be bought at an ordinary grocery store. We also propagate a few useful plants like mint and comfrey, which we give away for free.

Our designs involve plans for implementation and maintenance that you can mostly do yourself, and include advice on sourcing plants and contracting out specialised work.
We are committed to our customers spending as little as possible on plants and landscaping services - or that we are sharing everything we know, even though it leads to our customers not needing us any more - but we do not mind being generous with our passion and knowledge.
