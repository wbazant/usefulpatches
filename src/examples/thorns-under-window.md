In a house with ground window that may serve as a point of entry when opened or broken, reduce risk of unauthorised entry by planting a shrubbery underneath {function: security}.

Choose a shrub which is spiky and dense-growing while providing a useful enough yield to earn its place in the garden, like a blackthorn (*Prunus spinosa*) for sloes, or a berberis (*Berberis darwinii*) for barberries {function: bits and bobs}. Keep to shape with an occasional rough trim.
