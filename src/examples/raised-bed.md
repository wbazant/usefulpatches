Raised beds are not necessary in a garden with adequate soil, and can be a considerable expense when their building materials can not be easily sourced. Use them if you are getting started with edible growing, so you can focus attention on a small area {function: education} and prioritise species like cut-and-come-again lettuce that can be regularly used {function: bits and bobs} to optimise for value in from small area. Experiment with mulches, nets, glass panels, or cloches for keeping away pests, reducing watering needs, or creating beneficial microclimates. As you become more experienced, phase out crops that require a lot of labor, and transition the bed towards vigorous self-seeders like rocket or hardy herbaceous perennials like chard.
