A herbaceous border is a typical element of show gardens and estates, and its scaled-down versions are regularly installed by landscaping companies. Replicate it with crops like potato (*Solanum tuberosum*) or Jerusalem artichoke (*Helianthus tuberosus*), which in addition to edible tubers have attractive foliage and flowers {function: delight}. Create a border from perennials with edible tubers and try to give it an ornamental rather than farm-like look. At the end of the growing season, or in time of need, the border can be dug up and tubers harvested {function: reserve stock}.
