Hedges have a dual role in defensive landscaping: they obstruct access as well as visibility. On a 'patch' sized property in a city area, obstructing the view into the property is not a positive from a security perspective. Trim a hedge low, such that it obstructs access but keeps the street visible from inside the house, and outside of the house visible from the street {function: security}. Choose an easily maintainable shape for a regular yield of trimmings which are useful for mulching material {function: store of value}.
