A great number of beneficial annual plants will reseed themselves vigorously enough to stay in the garden with no maintenance. Increase proportion of garden in beneficial use by speculatively broadcasting seed or transplanting specimens to temporarily empty areas. It is less of a long-term commitment than planting a shrub which takes time to establish, or a rhizome-spreading perennial like mint which can be difficult to remove. Prioritise plants that will be of regular use to the household, like calendula (*Calendula officinalis*) for healing dry skin or fennel (*Foeniculum vulgare*) for seasoning dishes {function: bits and bobs}. Each plant established in the garden contributes to its overall genetic stock, and yields seed which will be useful to others {function: store of value}.
