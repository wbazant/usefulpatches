The west coast of Scotland has an excellent climate for soft fruit like raspberries, currants, gooseberries, and strawberries, and they require minimal care once stablished. Available fruit will invite browsing around the garden {function: delight}. Aim to create a long season in which a garden is producing fruit through diversity of species and cultivars, in addition to placement in a variety of microclimates, as a specimen in a warmer and sunnier spot will ripen earlier. Propagate shrubs through layering or root the cuttings after pruning to produce a trading surplus {function: store of value}.
