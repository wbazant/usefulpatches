A sheltered area that has adequate sunlight - like a southern facing side of a building - can be planted up with an arrangement of fruiting shrubs and trees. For a 'patch' garden in a Scottish climate, design this pattern around one hardy tree on a dwarf or semi-dwarf rootstock.

Suppress grasses under the tree with an understory of perennial herbs like mint which will be regularly useful in the kitchen {function: bits and bobs} and over time aim to fill out various niches of the space and increase diversity of the ecosystem {function: education}.
